          out, including figures, simple calculations, etc. and other information that isn’t critical need to be left out. The 
          Engineers Australia have set the word limit for career episodes, so be tactful in writing and including all 
          the crucial details in it. At this point, hiring a professional would be a great idea.`,

         excellent initiative to have someone else take a look at it, note down the points that can be improved, and tell you accordingly 
         about it. CDRReportWriters.com can be the best option for taking advice about your CDR. They provide high-quality CDR
